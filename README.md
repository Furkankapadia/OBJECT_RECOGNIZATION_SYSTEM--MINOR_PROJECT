# OBJECT_RECOGNIZATION_SYSTEM--MY_PROJECT
Hii, I'm Kapadia Mohammed Furkan from Bharuch Gujarat. Currently studying in third year of BTECH in CSE(MLAI) branch at PPSU. This is my first project name as "OBJECT  RECOGNIZATION SYSTEM".


In this project me and my teammates download the YOLOV8 DATASET from it's official website. In this dataset around 80 plus objects are predefine. We use the YOLOV8 model which is the letest model of object detection. First we create the full backend in PYTHON on GOOGLE COLAB and after create the frontend on VS CODE. We use FASTAPI to connect frontend with backend.
